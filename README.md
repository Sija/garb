Garb [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Sija/garb.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Sija/garb)
====

  http://github.com/Sija/garb

Important Changes
=================

  This fork contains heavily modified version of vigetlab's `Garb` library.
  It works only with version 3 of Google API.

  Please read CHANGELOG

Description
-----------

  Provides a Ruby API to the Google Analytics API.

  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/coreDevguide

Basic Usage
===========

Single User Login
-----------------
  
    > Garb::Session.api_key = api_key # required for 2-step authentication
    > Garb::Session.login(username, password)
    
OAuth Access Token
------------------

    > Garb::Session.access_token = access_token # an instance of OAuth2::Client

Accounts, WebProperties, Profiles, and Goals
--------------------------------------------

    > Garb::Management::Account.all
    > Garb::Management::WebProperty.all
    > Garb::Management::Profile.all
    > Garb::Management::Goal.all

Profiles for a UA- Number (a WebProperty)
-----------------------------------------

    > profile = Garb::Management::Profile.all.detect {|p| p.web_property_id == 'UA-XXXXXXX-X'}

Define a Report Class
---------------------

    class Exits
      extend Garb::Model

      metrics :exits, :pageviews
      dimensions :page_path
    end

Get the Results
---------------

    > Exits.results(profile, :filters => {:page_path.eql => '/'})

  OR shorthand

    > profile.exits(:filters => {:page_path.eql => '/'})

  Be forewarned, these numbers are for the last **30** days and may be slightly different from the numbers displayed in Google Analytics' dashboard for **1 month**.

Other Parameters
----------------

  * start_date: The date of the period you would like this report to start
  * end_date: The date to end, inclusive
  * limit: The maximum number of results to be returned
  * offset: The starting index
  * all: Return all results if true (which might result in several requests to GAPI)

Metrics & Dimensions
--------------------

  **Metrics and Dimensions are very complex because of the ways in which they can and cannot be combined.**

  I suggest reading the google documentation to familiarize yourself with this.

  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets#q=bouncerate

  When you've returned, you can pass the appropriate combinations to Garb, as symbols.

Filtering
---------

  Google Analytics supports a significant number of filtering options.

  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/reference#filters

  Here is what we can do currently:
  (the operator is a method on a symbol for the appropriate metric or dimension)

  Operators on metrics:

    eql => '==',
    not_eql => '!=',
    gt => '>',
    gte => '>=',
    lt => '<',
    lte => '<='

  Operators on dimensions:

    matches => '==',
    does_not_match => '!=',
    contains => '=~',
    does_not_contain => '!~',
    substring => '=@',
    not_substring => '!@'
    
  Given the previous Exits example report in shorthand, we can add an option for filter:

    profile.exits(:filters => {:page_path.eql => '/extend/effectively-using-git-with-subversion/')

SSL
---

  Version 0.2.3 includes support for real ssl encryption for SINGLE USER authentication. First do:

    Garb::Session.login(username, password, :secure => true)

  Next, be sure to download http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem into your application somewhere.
  Then, point `Garb.ca_cert_file` property to that file.

  For whatever reason, simply creating a new certificate store and setting the defaults would
  not validate the google ssl certificate as authentic.

OPEN / READ TIMEOUT
-------------------

  The open and read timeout values used with the network client (Net::HTTP) are configurable.
  Both values default to 60 seconds.  

    Garb.open_timeout = 3
    Garb.read_timeout = 3
    
TODOS
-----

  * rebuild AND/OR filtering in Garb::Model

Requirements
------------

  * active_support >= 2.2
  * multi_json >= 1.3

Requirements for Testing
------------------------

  * shoulda
  * mocha
  * bourne

    `git clone git://github.com/Sija/garb.git`
    `cd garb && rake install`
