Google Shutting Down Deprecated Auth on April 20th, 2015
--------------------------------------------------------

On April 20th, Google will be shutting down ClientLogin, AuthSub, and OAuth 1.0. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-analytics-api-notify/g8wbdUqEDd0

Legato
------

  There's rewritten and (moar) actively maintained version of the library in the form of [Legato](https://github.com/tpitale/legato).
  You might want to check it out as it's mostly compatible with `Garb`.

Important Changes
-----------------

  This fork contains heavily modified version of vigetlab's `Garb` library.
  It works only with version 3 of Google API.

  Please read CHANGELOG.

Description
-----------

  Provides a Ruby API to the Google Analytics API.

  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/coreDevguide

Basic Usage
===========

Single User Login
-----------------

```ruby
Garb::Session.api_key = api_key # required for 2-step authentication
Garb::Session.login(username, password)
```

OAuth Access Token
------------------

```ruby
Garb::Session.access_token = access_token # an instance of OAuth2::Client
```

Accounts, WebProperties, Profiles, and Goals
--------------------------------------------

```ruby
Garb::Management::Account.all
Garb::Management::WebProperty.all
Garb::Management::Profile.all
Garb::Management::Goal.all
```

Profiles for a UA- Number (a WebProperty)
-----------------------------------------

```ruby
profile = Garb::Management::Profile.all.detect { |p| p.web_property_id == 'UA-XXXXXXX-X' }
```

Define a Report Class
---------------------

```ruby
class Exits
  extend Garb::Model

  metrics :exits, :pageviews
  dimensions :page_path
end
```

Get the Results
---------------

```ruby
Exits.results(profile, filters: { :page_path.eql => '/' })
```

  OR shorthand

```ruby
profile.exits(filters: { :page_path.eql => '/' })
```

  Be forewarned, these numbers are for the last **30** days and may be slightly different from the numbers displayed in Google Analytics' dashboard for **1 month**.

Other Parameters
----------------

  * __start_date__: The date of the period you would like this report to start
  * __end_date__: The date to end, inclusive
  * __limit__: The maximum number of results to be returned
  * __offset__: The starting index
  * __all__: Return all results if true (which might result in several requests to GAPI)
  * __sampling_level__: Specify precision vs speed strategy (`default`, `faster`, `greater_precision`)

Metrics & Dimensions
--------------------

  **Metrics and Dimensions are very complex because of the ways in which they can and cannot be combined.**

  I suggest reading the google documentation to familiarize yourself with this.

  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets#q=bouncerate

  When you've returned, you can pass the appropriate combinations to Garb, as symbols.

Filtering
---------

  Google Analytics supports a significant number of filtering options.

  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/reference#filters

  Here is what we can do currently:
  (the operator is a method on a symbol for the appropriate metric or dimension)

  Operators on metrics:

```ruby
:eql      => '==',
:not_eql  => '!=',
:gt       => '>',
:gte      => '>=',
:lt       => '<',
:lte      => '<='
```

  Operators on dimensions:

```ruby
:matches          => '==',
:does_not_match   => '!=',
:contains         => '=~',
:does_not_contain => '!~',
:substring        => '=@',
:not_substring    => '!@'
```

  Given the previous Exits example report in shorthand, we can add an option for filter:

```ruby
profile.exits(filters: { :page_path.eql => '/extend/effectively-using-git-with-subversion/' })
```

SSL
---

  Version 0.2.3 includes support for real ssl encryption for SINGLE USER authentication. First do:

```ruby
Garb::Session.login(username, password, secure: true)
```

  Next, be sure to download https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem into your application somewhere.
  Then, point `Garb.ca_cert_file` property to that file.

  For whatever reason, simply creating a new certificate store and setting the defaults would
  not validate the google ssl certificate as authentic.

OPEN / READ TIMEOUT
-------------------

  The open and read timeout values used with the network client (Net::HTTP) are configurable.
  Both values default to 60 seconds.

```ruby
Garb.open_timeout = 3
Garb.read_timeout = 3
```

TODOS
-----

  * rebuild AND/OR filtering in Garb::Model

Requirements
------------

  * active_support >= 2.2
  * multi_json >= 1.3

Requirements for Testing
------------------------

  * shoulda
  * mocha
  * bourne

Install
-------

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'garb'
```

Then run:

```sh
bundle install
```
